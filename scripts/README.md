# Scripts Documentation

This directory contains various utility scripts for the Duve Helper application.

## Daily Task Scripts

### `test-daily.ts`
Runs the daily task manually for testing purposes.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-daily.ts
```

## Failed Lock Update Scripts

When lock code updates fail during the daily task, they are automatically logged to `logs/failed-lock-updates.json`. The following scripts help manage these failures:

### `view-failed-locks.ts`
Displays all failed lock updates without attempting to retry them.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/view-failed-locks.ts
```

**Output example:**
```
=== Failed Lock Updates (2 total) ===

üí° To retry these failed locks, run: npx tsx scripts/retry-failed-locks.ts
```

### `retry-failed-locks.ts`
Attempts to retry all failed lock updates with new codes.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/retry-failed-locks.ts
```

**Features:**
- Generates new lock codes for each retry
- Skips locks with "unknown" lockId (cannot be retried)
- Provides detailed progress and results
- Saves retry results to `logs/retry-results.json`
- Updates the failed locks file to remove successfully retried locks
