# Scripts Documentation

This directory contains various utility scripts for the Duve Helper application.

## Daily Task Scripts

### `test-daily.ts`
Runs the daily task manually for testing purposes.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-daily.ts
```

## Lock Profile Management

The lock profile system has been integrated into the daily task. Lock profiles and keyboard passwords are automatically refreshed at the beginning of each daily task run.

### `refresh-lock-profiles.ts`
Manually refreshes all lock profile data (equivalent to running clear-lock-profiles.ts, populate-lock-profiles.ts, and populate-keyboard-passwords.ts in sequence).

```bash
npx tsx scripts/refresh-lock-profiles.ts
```

**Features:**
- Clears all existing lock profiles and keyboard passwords
- Fetches latest lock data from Sifely API
- Populates lock profiles with current lock information
- Fetches and stores keyboard passwords for each lock
- Integrated logging with [LockProfileManager] prefix

**Note:** This process is automatically run at the beginning of each daily task, so manual execution is typically only needed for debugging or testing purposes.

### Legacy Scripts (Still Available)

The following individual scripts are still available for debugging purposes:

#### `clear-lock-profiles.ts`
Clears all lock profiles and keyboard passwords from the database.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/clear-lock-profiles.ts
```

#### `populate-lock-profiles.ts`
Fetches locks from the Sifely API and populates the lock profiles table.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/populate-lock-profiles.ts
```

#### `populate-keyboard-passwords.ts`
Fetches keyboard passwords for all locks and populates the keyboard passwords table.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/populate-keyboard-passwords.ts
```

**Migration Note:** Instead of running these three scripts separately, use `refresh-lock-profiles.ts` or let the daily task handle it automatically.

## Failed Lock Update Scripts

When lock code updates fail during the daily task, they are automatically logged to the database. The following scripts help manage these failures:

### `view-failed-locks.ts`
Displays all failed lock updates without attempting to retry them.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/view-failed-locks.ts
```

**Features:**
- Reads failed lock updates from the database (primary source)
- Fallback to file system for backward compatibility
- Works in serverless environments (Vercel, AWS Lambda, etc.)

**Output example:**
```
=== Failed Lock Updates (2 total) ===

1. 123 Main St, New York - John Doe
   Reservation ID: abc123
   Lock ID: 5703050
   Duve ID: cmcjfragk00pu070w964sln4r
   Dates: 1/15/2024 - 1/17/2024
   Error: Lock code update failed
   Failed at: 1/14/2024, 10:30:45 AM

üí° To retry these failed locks, run: npx tsx scripts/retry-failed-locks.ts
```

### `retry-failed-locks.ts`
Attempts to retry all failed lock updates with new codes.
```bash
npx tsx scripts/retry-failed-locks.ts
```

**Features:**
- Reads failed lock updates from the database (primary source)
- Generates new lock codes for each retry
- Skips locks with "unknown" lockId (cannot be retried)
- Provides detailed progress and results
- Removes successfully retried locks from the database
- Fallback to file system for backward compatibility
- Works in serverless environments (Vercel, AWS Lambda, etc.)

**Output example:**
```
Found 2 failed lock updates to retry...

Retrying lock update for: 123 Main St, New York - John Doe
Lock ID: 5703050, Reservation ID: abc123
‚úÖ Successfully retried lock code update

Retrying lock update for: 456 Oak Ave, Boston - Jane Smith
Lock ID: 7706256, Reservation ID: def456
‚ùå Failed to retry lock code update

=== Retry Summary ===
Total attempted: 2
Successful: 1
Failed: 1
Database updated - 1 locks still failed
```

## Serverless Environment Support

The failed lock update system now works seamlessly in serverless environments:

- **Database-first approach**: Failed locks are stored in the database
- **File system fallback**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing file-based logs
- **Automatic detection**: Skips file operations in serverless environments (Vercel, AWS Lambda, etc.)
- **No file system errors**: Prevents `ENOENT` errors in read-only file systems

## File Structure

```
logs/                            # Only used in non-serverless environments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ failed-lock-updates.json    # Fallback storage for failed lock updates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retry-results.json          # Results from retry attempts (file-based only)
```

**Note**: In serverless environments, all failed lock data is stored in the database, eliminating the need for file system access.

## Daily Task Summary

The daily task now provides a detailed summary including:
- Total reservations processed
- Number of lock code update failures
- Number of successful lock code updates
- Instructions for retrying failed updates

**Example output:**
```
=== Daily Task Summary ===
Total reservations processed: 11
Lock code update failures: 1
Successful lock code updates: 10
‚ö†Ô∏è  1 lock code updates failed. Check logs/failed-lock-updates.json for details.
üí° Run 'npx tsx scripts/retry-failed-locks.ts' to retry failed lock updates.
```

## Logging Details

Failed lock updates include:
- Reservation ID and Duve ID
- Lock ID
- Full property address
- Guest name
- Check-in and check-out dates
- Error message
- Timestamp of failure

This information helps with debugging and provides context for retry attempts.

## Manual Lock Update Script

### `manual-lock-update.ts`

```bash
# Interactive mode (prompts for all parameters)
npx tsx scripts/manual-lock-update.ts
